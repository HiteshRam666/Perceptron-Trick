# 🌟 Perceptron Trick 

Welcome to the **Perceptron Trick** project! This repository contains an interactive Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the Perceptron algorithm's functionality and showcases a specific "trick" to improve its performance. 

## 🚀 Features

- **Intuitive Visualizations**: Understand the Perceptron algorithm with detailed visual explanations.
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Follow along with the notebook as it explains each part of the algorithm.
- **Experiment-Friendly**: Modify parameters and see how they affect the outcome directly in the notebook.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`Perceptron_trick.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook where all the magic happens! 🎩✨
- **`data/`**: Directory for datasets used in the notebook (if any).
- **`images/`**: Directory for images used in the notebook (if any).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and open the Jupyter notebook in your favorite environment.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts 🤖
